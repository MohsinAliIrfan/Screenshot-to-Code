THATS IT!!

The backend directory holds all the backend working of the website which includes code generating agent, image conversion, jira termplate, dealing with possible error.
I have also inluded some images directly in the backend direcory so you can test the backend directly if required without running the frontend.
so, for that
- cd backend

In the main.py file, include your api key and call the function(), and you can see the output directly in your console.
